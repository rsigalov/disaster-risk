# This script creates a local environment and installs necessary libraries

# cd into folder where you want to install the virtual environment
# (e.g. into code folder in the project folder)

# 1. Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv DRenv

# 2. Activate a virtual environment
source DRenv/bin/activate

# 3. Upgrading pip
pip install --upgrade pip

# 4. Make sure python and pip point to correct binaries and
#    there are no libraries installed in pip
which python
which pip
pip list

# 5. Installing libraries (timeit and importlib are already a part of python)
pip install numba 
pip install notebook pandas statsmodels matplotlib openpyxl scipy pandasql # Standard libraries
pip install psycopg2-binary # connecting to PostgreSQL server
# pip install wrds # to load accounting data from WRDS

# 6. To connect this environment to workspace in Visual Studio Code add line
#
#    "python.defaultInterpreterPath": "${workspaceFolder}/DRenv/bin/python"
#
# to .vscode/settings.json (i.e. workspace settings file).
# To open(create if it is not there yet) .vscode/settings.json file can also 
# do Shift+Cmd+P to open command palette and look for Preference: Open Workspace Setting (JSON)
